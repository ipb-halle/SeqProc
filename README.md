# SeqProc
A simple example wrapper for a command line tool with graphical interface.

This tools opens a window where input files can be dropped. The files are then processed one by one. Use this as a template for little helper.

The actual work done by this tool is to split a sequence into two fragments and add some aditional content in preparation of a ligation.
